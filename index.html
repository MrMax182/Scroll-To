				<div class="column_1">Scrolling to a spot in an HTML page is pretty simple to do with JQuery, but if you have a lot of IDs on the page to scroll to, the code can get a little messy. This plugin solves that by allowing you to write your anchor tags just as you normally would with the <em>href</em> attribute pointed at the ID you would like to move to (e.g. href="#importantSection".) This means that if JavaScript is turned off, your site will continue to function normally. You can offset the location of where you scroll to, control the speed and override the element ID you are scrolling to all through the plugin.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column_1">
					<p class="code">&lt;a href=&quot;#spotToGoTo&quot; id=&quot;selector&quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row readable">
				<div class="column_1">
					<p>The plugin will still set the hash value (i.e. #anchorPoint) like normal so you can still deep link into your page, however for browsers that do not support <em>history.pushState</em>, there may be issues with using <em>offset</em>. This is because for those browsers, you cannot stop the window from firing the <em>onHashChange</em> event, which will then jump to the exact location. If you&apos;re not using <em>offset</em> however, everything will work normally.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row readable">
				<div class="column_4">
					<h3>offset</h3>
					<p class="readable">By default, the plugin will scroll the top of the element you&apos;ve set, but sometimes you might want it to go slightly higher or lower. This parameter will allow you to offset the scroll position positively (down) or negatively (up) by the amount of pixels you set. The default value is <strong>0</strong>.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column_4">
					<h3>speed</h3>
					<p class="readable">The plugin uses the <em>animate</em> method in JQuery, so you can pass through the speed of the animation through this parameter. It can either be a string (e.g. &apos;fast&apos;) or a number (e.g. 300). The default value is <stong>&apos;slow&apos;</strong></p>
				</div>
				<div class="column_4">
					<h3>override</h3>
					<p class="readable">The plugin works by grabbing the <em>href</em> attribute of the selected element and setting that as the scroll-to position. You can however override this functionality by passing the <em>id</em> of the element you wish to scroll to. The default value is <strong>null</strong>.</p>
				</div>	
				<div class="column_4">
					<h3>easing</h3>
					<p class="readable">With the latest version, the plugin now supports easing algorithms, which you can include with <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">JQuery UI</a>. The default value is <strong>null</strong>.</p>
